# Code Trainer

This repository provides a small web application to help you practice LeetCode problems. The backend is built with **FastAPI** and tries to fetch the latest problem list from LeetCode. If the remote request fails, it falls back to the local `problems.json` file.

## Running the app

1. Install `uv` and the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the server using `uvicorn`:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and choose a difficulty.

## Online Code Runner

Once you select a problem you can navigate to `/solve/<slug>` (e.g. `/solve/two-sum`)
to open a simple editor. Write Python code and press **Run Code** to execute it
serverâ€‘side. The `/execute` API endpoint runs the submitted code using the local
Python interpreter and returns the output.

## Docker

You can also run the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The fallback problems are defined in `problems.json`. Feel free to extend this file with more LeetCode problems.
