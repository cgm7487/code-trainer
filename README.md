# Code Trainer

This repository provides a small web application to help you practice LeetCode problems. The app lets you choose a difficulty level and returns a random problem from a predefined list.

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and choose a difficulty.

The problems are defined in `problems.json`. Feel free to extend this file with more LeetCode problems.
